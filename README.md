# Insurance Risk Analytics & Predictive Modeling

[![Continuous Integration](https://github.com/Avicci-b/Insurance-risk-analytics/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Avicci-b/Insurance-risk-analytics/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Business Problem

AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS) wants to identify low‑risk customer segments to offer competitive premiums and attract new clients, while maintaining overall profitability. Currently, pricing is uniform across regions, leading to missed opportunities (e.g., Gauteng has 122.2% loss ratio, Northern Cape only 28.3%). This project aims to:

- Uncover risk drivers using historical claim data.
- Build predictive models to assess individual policy risk.
- Provide data‑backed recommendations for premium adjustments.

## Solution Overview

We analyzed **1,000,098 policies** from Feb 2014 – Aug 2015 using a four‑phase approach:

1. **EDA** – Corrected a critical data misinterpretation (monthly vs annual premiums) and identified large geographic disparities.
2. **Data Version Control** – Implemented DVC to ensure reproducibility and audit compliance.
3. **Hypothesis Testing** – Statistically validated that risk varies by province and zip code (p < 0.001) but not by gender (p > 0.45).
4. **Predictive Modeling** – Built a two‑stage model (classification + regression) achieving **80.84% recall** for claim detection and created a risk scoring system (0–100) to guide pricing.

## Key Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Corrected loss ratio** | 8.7% (was 104.77% before correction) |
| **Geographic profitability gap** | 93.9% between Gauteng and Northern Cape |
| **Claim detection recall** | 80.84% (Logistic Regression) |
| **Risk‑based premium range** | -15% to +25% adjustment |
| **Statistical confidence (geography)** | p < 0.001 (99.9% confidence) |

## Technical Details
# Data
- Source: ACIS historical claims (Feb 2014 – Aug 2015)
- Size: 1,000,098 policies, 49 original columns
- Preprocessing:
     - Corrected premium scaling (×12)
     - Selected 15 features based on EDA and hypothesis tests
     - Ordinal encoding for high‑cardinality categoricals

# Models

- Classification (Logistic Regression) – predicts TotalClaims with 80.84% recall.
- Regression (Linear Regression) – predicts TotalClaims amount (R² = 0.30).
- Risk Score = Probability × Expected Amount, scaled 0‑100.

# Evaluation
- Classification metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC‑AUC.
- Regression metrics: R², RMSE, MAE.
- Cross‑validation on 500K sample due to memory constraints.

# Future Improvements

- Incorporate telematics and credit score data.
- Retrain models quarterly with new data.
- Implement A/B testing for premium adjustments.
- Add SHAP explanations directly in the dashboard.
